## Week02

### 1. Sum.java
- **Description:** Takes two integer inputs from the user using the Scanner class, calculates their sum, and prints the result.

### 2. Calc.java
- **Description:** Command-line calculator that takes two integer arguments and performs arithmetic operations such as sum, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. Prints the results.

### 3. MonthInfo.java
- **Description:** Uses the Scanner class to take a user-inputted month number, categorizes it, and prints its number of days using a switch statement.

### 4. Fact.java
- **Description:** Contains a for loop that iterates through the input number, calculates the factorial, and prints the result.

### 5. Average.java
- **Description:** Uses Scanner inside a while loop to read integers until the end of the file. Calculates the sum of numbers using a loop and tracks the number of them with a counter. Prints the average, and if no numbers are included, prints an "error" message.

### 6. Harmonic.java
- **Description:** Uses a for loop that iterates from 1 to the user-inputted number, accumulating the sum of reciprocals. Prints the result.

### 7. Digits.java
- **Description:** Iterates through the digits of a user-inputted number, calculates the sum, product, and average of the digits, and prints the result.

### 8. CoinToss.java
- **Description:** Uses a for loop to iterate through coin tosses, employing Math.random() for determining heads or tails. Calculates and prints probabilities of heads and tails.

### 9. RandomPointsInCircle.java
- **Description** Geterates and prints the random points inside the circle that its radius is 1 and center is (0,0). It uses Scanner class for obtaining the number of points. Random class is for generating random point within the range of [-1;1]. For loop is for iteration in "n" times and it checks each point that is inside the circle. If it is in, program prints this point in the "(x,y)" format.
