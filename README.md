  -**Sum.java**: The program takes two integer inputs from the user with the Scanner class, finds their sum and prints the result
  -**Calc.java**: This program is basically command-line calculator that takes two integer argumates and apples numerous arithmetic operations on them like sum, subtraction, multiplication, division and remainder and prints them
  -**MonthInfo.java**: This program employs Scanner class for taking the user-inputted month number and categorize it to the compatible month and prints its number of days by the switch statement
  -**Fact.java**: This java code contains for loop that iterates throught the input number and multiplies all integers until the number which is basically factorial and prints the number
  -**Average.java**: This program uses Scanner inside while loop for reading the integers till the end of file. It calculates the sum of numbers by loop and tracks the number of them by counter so each iteration, counter increments. The for finding average, conditional statement checks if counter is not 0 and the sum is divided by counter and for accuracy the double type is used. If no number is included by user, program prints "error" message
  -**Harmonic.java**: This program uses for loop that iterates from 1 to the user-inputted number and accumulating the sum of reciprocals. Then the result is printed to the console
  -**Digits.java**: The program iterates through its digits and calculates the sum, product and average of them and prints the result. For loop's function is that in each iteration, inputted number divided by 10 and the remainder is used for arithmetic operations.
  -**CoinToss.java**: This program uses for loop to iterate through the tosses of coin and it uses Math.random() method for determining whether each toss results in heads or tails. Then it calculates and prints probabilities of heads and tails.
